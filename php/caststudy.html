    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>ok</p>
    <h2>Context / Challenge</h2>
    <p>This project was focused around using PHP and either MAMP or WAMP to produce a website for around 40 recipes.  These recipes came with JPGs, PNGs, and PDFs that carried all of the information required for this project.  We were given about ten weeks from the start to the end of a term during Drexel's Spring term.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this project was to both teach and get familiar with PHP and loops in coding.  This project also helped students to become used to creating, updating and maintaining databases for MySQL.</p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>For the project, due to the short timeline given and the brand new coding language to learn and use, I knew that I had to focus on learning PHP.  My HTML and CSS was simple and kept to a minimum so more time could be focused on a working PHP recipe site.</p>
