				<p class="instructionstext">I’m the best thing that ever happened to placeholder text. You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina.</p>

				<p class="instructionstext">You're telling the enemy exactly what you're going to do. No wonder you've been fighting Lorem Ipsum your entire adult life. You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice."</p>

				<p class="instructionstext">An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud. Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text.</p>

				<p class="instructionstext">Lorem Ipsum better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! This placeholder text is gonna be HUGE.
